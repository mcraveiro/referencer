taglist and tagger need to be in scrolledwindows
DONE need to update tagger when rename tag
	tagging and tag create/delete seems a bit buggy still
need to update docicons when tagging file (time to be more efficient)
LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.

A View menu which allows hiding of "Tag Bar"

Drag and drop to add by filename
Add by DOI
Add by nothing but displayname
Progressbar when adding (many or one, both can be slow)

We should write to file and then copy into place (prevent crash blanking file)


DONE Default thumbnail for unthumbnailable things
	Although it relies on unknown.png in current path, should get from iconfactory
DONE Thumbnail generation
	Now do it in the background?
