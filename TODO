Essential:
	Store relative document file paths where possible
	Crash removing tags?
	Chapters in InCollection get added as "Title" extra field in bibtex import

Big functionality wishlist:
	OAI support for arXiv and CrossRef (and possibly many others)
	Google scholar link?  Arbitrary links?
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Copy added (remote?) files into a local directory
	"Manage BibTeX File" as well as one-off export
	Documents need some unique ID.  Currently keys are created as unique but there
		is nothing stopping user from creating by hand or importing dups.

Little functionality wishlist:
	gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Make search bar match more fields

UI wishlist:
	Save in Preferences the sorting of the list view.
	An "Untagged" special tag like All
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to import bibtex snippets
	Copy document key to clipboard
	Should complain when adding files we already have
	Thumbnail generation is done in main thread and freezes UI
	Configuration of proxy server for non-GNOMEers
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef
	Somehow know when to add et. al. to authors

Bugs:
	In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
		in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
		bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites
	Removing documents uses key_ as if it were unique, which it is not guaranteed to be

EndNote is also somewhat DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
Take heart, endnote is slow and crummy and easy to be better than for simple bibtex use

Competition on Science biblio export:
	EndNote
	Reference Manager
	ProCite
	RefWorks
also: Zotero
