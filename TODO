Use installed libsexy if available, a la rhythmbox

Other essential items:
	Import of reflib files (merge in documents, resolve tag IDs)
	Sizing of columns in the list view
	LyX citation via lyxserver (pybliographic, lyx/src/client)
	Command line reflib->bibtex
	Check that UTF-8 export works as desired

	BibTeX export:
		What about underscores?  Need an "escape everything" mode?
		Write out tags as special bibtex field
	Resolve symlinks before doing relative filename magic

	Support new endxmlin, isiout and wordout from bibutils 3.31?

	Edit menu:
		- Copy key
		- copy filename
		- copy bibtex ?
		- paste bibtex ?

	When importing endnote, %Y is series editor, but this is lost by bibutils for refs of inappropriate type.  %Y is used in pablo's file as generic author. - that was with endnote 3, try with more recent endnote	

Big functionality wishlist:
	OAI support for arXiv and CrossRef (and possibly many others)
		http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/oai/oai.cgi
		http://arxiv.org/oai2
		http://oai.crossref.org/OAIHandler/
	add by pubmed/medline ID (pubmed OAI)	

	searching databases?
	Google scholar link?  Arbitrary links?
	Parse strings "Title: foo\nISBN: bar\n" like recipe manager
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Copy added (remote?) files into a local directory
	Formatted bibliographies with Rtfbtx?
	Tracker?  Beagle?

Little functionality wishlist:
	import/export "keywords" field in bibtex, map to referencer tags
	Some support for moving file to trash instead of deleting
	Set tags based on folder names when doing recursive import (Wilhelms, C.)
	gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Make search bar match more fields
	Tell the user somehow in addDocFiles when we don't add files b/c they're already in the documentlist.
	Assign a color to a tag and highlight refs with it
	Should take relative filenames over absolute ones, if the two differ
	Should have GPL headers in all files to qualify for debian packaging

UI wishlist:
	entry for tags in the properties dialog "foo, bar, baz"
	say "1 document" instead of "1 documents" in statusbar
	Size-varying list of tags, bold for toggling on/off
	Save in Preferences the sorting of the list view.
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to import bibtex snippets
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef
	click-to-edit in list view

Bugs:
	In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
		in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
		bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites


Competition on Science biblio export:
	EndNote
		EndNote is also somewhat DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
	Reference Manager
	ProCite
	RefWorks
also: Zotero
also: Yep
