Essential:
  Appropriate copyright notice for abiword-stolen UC->Latex
	BibTeX import (and merging with metadata-less PDFs?)

Niceties:
	LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.
	A View menu which allows hiding of tagging sidebar

Big functionality wishlist:
	arXiv support:
		regex the code out the PDF
		http://www.citebase.org/openurl?svc_id=bibtex&rft_id=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Ahep-lat%2F0306023
		Alternatively OAI support for arXiv and CrossRef (and possibly many others)
	Search bar
	Table view as well as icon view
	Google scholar link?  Arbitrary links?
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Copy added (remote?) files into a local directory
	Save and load libraries to arbitrary locations
	"Manage BibTeX File" as well as one-off export

Little functionality wishlist:
	gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any

UI wishlist:
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to import bibtex snippets
	Copy document key to clipboard
	Should complain when adding files we already have
	Thumbnail generation is done in main thread and freezes UI
	Configuration of proxy server for non-GNOMEers
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef
	Somehow know when to add et. al. to authors
	Selective bibtex output

Bugs:
	DocumentProperties should shrink when extra fields is collapsed, it doesn't.
	Tagger's scrolledwindow seems to have a shadow/border even though we ask it not to
	In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
		in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
		bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites

EndNote is also somewhat DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
Take heart, endnote is slow and crummy and easy to be better than for simple bibtex use

Competition on Science biblio export:
	EndNote
	Reference Manager
	ProCite
	RefWorks
also: Zotero
