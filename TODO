Bugs
====

In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
	in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
	bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites

When importing endnote, %Y is series editor, but this is lost by bibutils for refs of inappropriate type.  %Y is used in pablo's file as generic author. - that was with endnote 3, try with more recent endnote	


Unscheduled items
=================

Import of reflib files (merge in documents, resolve tag IDs)

LyX citation via lyxserver (pybliographic, lyx/src/client)

Verify that UTF-8 export works as per user expectations

Improve BibTeX export robustness
	What about underscores?  Need an "escape everything" mode?
	Document requirements/exceptions

Support new endxmlin, isiout and wordout from bibutils >= 3.31

	Set tags based on folder names when doing recursive import (Wilhelms, C.)
	Create a gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Make search bar match more fields
	Tell the user somehow in addDocFiles when we don't add files b/c they're already in the documentlist.
	Assign a color to a tag and highlight refs with it
	Should have GPL headers in all files to qualify for debian packaging
