Bugs
====

In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
	in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
	bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites

When importing endnote, %Y is series editor, but this is lost by bibutils for refs of inappropriate type.  %Y is used in pablo's file as generic author. - that was with endnote 3, try with more recent endnote	


Unscheduled items
=================

Import of reflib files (merge in documents, resolve tag IDs)

LyX citation via lyxserver (pybliographic, lyx/src/client)

Verify that UTF-8 export works as per user expectations

Improve BibTeX export robustness
	What about underscores?  Need an "escape everything" mode?
	Document requirements/exceptions

Support new endxmlin, isiout and wordout from bibutils >= 3.31

Possible items
==============

Edit menu:
	- Copy key
	- copy filename
	- copy bibtex

Functionality wishlist:
	Parse strings "Title: foo\nISBN: bar\n" like recipe manager
	Formatted bibliographies with Rtfbtx?
	Import "keywords" field in bibtex, map to referencer tags
	Move file to trash instead of deleting
	Set tags based on folder names when doing recursive import (Wilhelms, C.)
	Create a gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Make search bar match more fields
	Tell the user somehow in addDocFiles when we don't add files b/c they're already in the documentlist.
	Assign a color to a tag and highlight refs with it
	Use installed libsexy if available, a la rhythmbox
	Resolve symlinks before doing relative filename magic

UI wishlist:
	say "1 document" instead of "1 documents" in statusbar
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to import bibtex snippets
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef

The Competition
===============

EndNote
	EndNote is somewhat DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
Reference Manager
ProCite
RefWorks
Zotero
Yep
