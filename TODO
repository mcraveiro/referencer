Essential:
	Conversion of accented characters into LaTeX when exporting (and importing?) bibtex
	Should write to file and then copy into place (prevent crash blanking file)
	'Work offline'

Niceties:
	LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.
	A View menu which allows hiding of tagging sidebar

Functionality wishlist:
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Drag and drop to add by filename
	Should complain when adding files we already have
	Thumbnail generation is done in main thread and freezes UI
	"Manage BibTeX File" as well as one-off export
	BibTeX import (and merging with metadata-less PDFs?)
	Configuration of lookup URLs
	Configuration of proxy server for non-GNOMEers

Bugs:
	Crash when adding unnamed?
	Tagger's scrolledwindow seems to have a shadow/border even though we ask it not to
