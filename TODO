Plugin ideas:
	mangle/demangle Doe, J vs Doe, J.

	Browse/search:
		Z39.50
		PubMed

	"More by this author" on pubmed and google


There is no release schedule.
	Fix the document properties and storage
		- Merge BibData and Document
		- Add protect flag for user edits
		- Revise file format (dublin core?)
		- Properties pane in RefWindow

	Simplify tagging internals
		- Do away with magic UIDs and pass strings around

	ListView users are people too:
		- Sort out the column sizing
		- Adding/removing columns

	Getting text from .ps files (a la ps2ascii)
	Refine tagging UI:
		Text entry view of tags
	Deal with external added URIs
		UI for setting "library directory"
		Offer to move files not in subdir of reflib location

	OAI support:
		Arxiv database
			http://arxiv.org/oai2
		PubMed database
			http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/oai/oai.cgi

	Integration with Tracker and/or Beagle
	

Bugs
====

In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
	in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
	bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites

Paste from gecko doesn't seem to work

When importing endnote, %Y is series editor, but this is lost by bibutils for refs of inappropriate type.  %Y is used in pablo's file as generic author. - that was with endnote 3, try with more recent endnote	


Unscheduled items
=================

Import of reflib files (merge in documents, resolve tag IDs)

Verify that UTF-8 export works as per user expectations

Improve BibTeX export robustness
	What about underscores?  Need an "escape everything" mode?
	Insert \url bits
	Document requirements/exceptions

Support new endxmlin, isiout and wordout from bibutils >= 3.31

Possible items
==============

Edit menu:
	- Copy key
	- copy filename
	- copy bibtex

Functionality wishlist:
	Parse strings "Title: foo\nISBN: bar\n" like recipe manager
	Formatted bibliographies with Rtfbtx?
	Import "keywords" field in bibtex, map to referencer tags
	Move file to trash instead of deleting
	Set tags based on folder names when doing recursive import (Wilhelms, C.)
	Create a gconf schema
	Get document type from crossref XML instead of assuming Article
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Assign a color to a tag and highlight refs with it
	Use installed libsexy if available, a la rhythmbox
	Resolve symlinks before doing relative filename magic

UI wishlist:
	say "1 document" instead of "1 documents" in statusbar
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to import bibtex snippets
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef

The Competition
===============

EndNote
	EndNote is somewhat DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
Reference Manager
ProCite
RefWorks
Zotero
Yep
