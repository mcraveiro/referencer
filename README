Referencer
==========
A document organiser and bibliography manager

Building
========

A simple 'make' should build the referencer executable, if the dependencies are present.

The build dependencies are:
	g++
	poppler
	gtkmm-2.4
	libgnomeuimm-2.6 
	gnome-vfsmm-2.6
	libglademm-2.4
	gconfmm-2.6
	boost_regex

On Ubuntu 6.10, all of these may be obtained by running the following command:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgnomeuimm-2.6-dev libgnome-vfsmm-2.6-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgconfmm-2.6-dev libboost-regex-dev

Installing
==========

Referencer may be run in-place from the build directory for convenient evaluation or testing.  Alternatively, it maybe installed systemwide: running 'make install' should install Referencer into the /usr/local prefix.  Edit the 'PREFIX' variable in Makefile and rebuild to install to a different location.
