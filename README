Building
========

A simple './configure && make' should build the referencer executable, if the dependencies are present.

The build dependencies are:
	g++
	poppler
	gtkmm-2.4
	libgnomeuimm-2.6 
	gnome-vfsmm-2.6
	libglademm-2.4
	gconfmm-2.6
	boost_regex
	intltool

On Ubuntu 6.10 (or 6.04 LTS), all of these may be obtained by running the following command:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgnomeuimm-2.6-dev libgnome-vfsmm-2.6-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgconfmm-2.6-dev libboost-regex-dev intltool
	
(note that libboost-regex-dev is in the 'universe' repository, which is not enabled in a default Ubuntu install.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/extra-repositories.html)


NOTE TO FEDORA USERS: Unfortuately the poppler interface used in Referencer is not supported in the fedora poppler development packages -- to build Referencer it is necessary to separately download poppler source packages, and edit the Referencer Makefile to find this directory.  Note that the binary library itself is fine on Fedora, it's just the headers that are problematic, so once it is built it can be distributed without problems.
On Fedora Core 5, you will need to do:
	yum install gtkmm24-devel libgnomeuimm26-devel gnome-vfsmm26-devel libglademm24-devel gconfmm26-devel poppler-devel gcc-c++ boost-devel



Installing
==========

Referencer may be run in-place from the build directory for convenient evaluation or testing.  Alternatively, it maybe installed systemwide: running 'make install' should install Referencer into the /usr/local prefix.  Edit the 'PREFIX' variable in Makefile and rebuild to install to a different location.
